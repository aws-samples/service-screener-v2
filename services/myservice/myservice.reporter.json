Reconfigure production RDS instances to Multi-AZ. For Aurora clusters, have at least two instances (one each in a different availability zone).

Converting a single-AZ instance to multi-AZ instances will avoid downtime but you can experience performance impact. You should perform this operation during off-peak hours. You can also create a read replica in a different AZ and then perform a failover.",
